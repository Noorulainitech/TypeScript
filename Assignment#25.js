// Task : 25 [Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called 
// alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.]
var alien_color = "green";
// Part : 1
// Write an if statement to test whether the alienâ€™s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
if (alien_color == "green") {
    console.log("Your Earn 5 Points");
}
// Part : 2
// Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
